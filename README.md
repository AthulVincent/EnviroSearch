# EnviroSearch
EnviroSearch is an android app that utilizes Google Custom Search JSON API to allow users to assess the environmental impact of companies by crawling through the web to find relevant articles, pages, and documents that exemplifies the company's track-record in operating in an environmentally (un)sustainable manner.

## Inspiration

We were inspired by our own past experiences—when wanting to purchase a product from a company, we have sought to analyze their environmental impact, but have been unable to do so in a quick, reliable manner. Googling a company often produces ambiguous results, wastes the user’s time, and leads to further confusion about a corporation’s past.

Accordingly, our team created EnviroSearch: an app that allows users to easily find relevant articles about a company’s environmental impact. With EnviroSearch, users can purchase products with confidence, knowing that they’ve thoroughly analyzed a corporation’s environmental footprint.


## Implementation
We utilized Android Studio as the platform to develop our app’s front-end. This included a homepage with an animated information graphic and interactive search icon, and a results page to display relevant articles/websites. We programmed on Android Studio through Java. To retrieve customized, relevant search results based on user query, we used Google’s Custom Search API and Programmable Search Engine. Additionally, we integrated Java’s .Net library to communicate with google, and the JSON library to parse and display the responses.

## Future
EnviroSearch plans to integrate natural language processing and machine learning to use Google's search results to rate each company's environmental impact, providing users with a trusted, simple analysis. Another feature we plan to add is a database for recent searches and a page detailing commonly-searched corporations and their history using SQLite
